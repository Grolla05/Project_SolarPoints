## Reporting a Vulnerability

The circuit developed by our team throughout the project’s prototyping phase was designed to be a self-sustaining and intelligent system, requiring no human intervention. However, our greatest challenge was completing the task without using any microcontrollers (such as Arduino), which ultimately made the project more viable in terms of cost and performance. That said, several concerns were raised regarding potential vulnerabilities—particularly with the battery—since circuits of this nature often suffer from chronic issues like battery degradation or loss of capacity over time.
