## 🌙 What is Solar Points?

**Solar Points** is an **autonomous and intelligent public lighting system** designed for areas lacking electrical infrastructure, such as:

- Bus stops  
- Alleys and narrow streets  
- Public squares  
- Peripheral and isolated regions  

This project aims to provide **greater safety and well-being** to communities through a **low-cost, sustainable, and technically efficient solution**.

## 🔧 Project Highlights

Beyond its practical application, this project demonstrates the **feasibility of automation systems** based entirely on **classical electronics**, without using microcontrollers or programmable platforms (such as Arduino).

📎 Key aspects:

- Circuits built **exclusively with discrete components and analog ICs**
- Eliminates the energy consumption of microcontrollers
- Focus on **simplicity, robustness, and reliability**
- Ideal for contexts with **limited resources and low-maintenance requirements**
